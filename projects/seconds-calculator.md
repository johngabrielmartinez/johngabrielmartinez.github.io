This project involved writing a Java program that calculates the total number of seconds from user-provided values for hours, minutes, and seconds. The program prompts the user for each input and then performs the necessary arithmetic calculations to combine them into a single total. The goal of the project was to practice working with user input and basic arithmetic operations in Java.

I completed this project independently, handling the program design, implementation, and testing. I used Java’s `Scanner` class to read user input from the console and applied simple mathematical formulas to convert hours and minutes into seconds. I tested the program using different input values to ensure the calculations produced correct results.

Through this project, I gained practice working with console input and output, as well as reinforcing my understanding of arithmetic reasoning in Java. The project helped solidify how user input flows through a program and how even small programs require careful attention to logic and formatting to produce correct and readable output.
