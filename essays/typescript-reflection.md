Coming into this module, TypeScript felt familiar on the surface but different in practice. Having prior experience with Java and some exposure to JavaScript, I expected TypeScript to be simply “JavaScript with types.” What I quickly realized is that TypeScript changes how you *think* about code. Types force you to be explicit about intent, assumptions, and edge cases much earlier than in JavaScript. Compared to Java, TypeScript feels lighter and more flexible, but still provides enough structure to prevent many common mistakes. That balance has made me more aware of how design decisions show up even in small programs.

One of the biggest shifts for me was learning to work with modern ES6 features alongside TypeScript’s type system. Arrow functions, template literals, and sets all encouraged cleaner and more intentional code. I also became more conscious of guarding inputs early and ordering conditional logic correctly. Writing functions that clearly handle invalid inputs before performing calculations helped reinforce the idea that correctness starts at the boundaries, not just in the final formula or output.

The athletic software engineering approach, especially the practice WODs, had a noticeable impact on how I learned. Working under time pressure exposed a lot of gaps in my understanding very quickly. While stressful at times, the format forced me to focus on fundamentals rather than overthinking details. Repeating similar problems helped build muscle memory around control flow, guard clauses, and range-based logic. Over time, I’m confident the stress will become more manageable, but right now I’m still in the process of learning to trust my problem-solving approach.

Overall, I think TypeScript is a strong programming language from a software engineering perspective. It encourages better design habits without being overly rigid, and it scales well from small scripts to larger systems. Combined with the WOD-style practice, it has helped me become more confident writing code quickly while still thinking carefully about structure and correctness. This learning style is challenging, but it’s one I can see myself benefiting from long-term.
